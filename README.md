## Abstract

This illustrative example, written for ScicosLab, supports the theoretical results proposed in the paper "Robust Synchronization Problems for Max-plus Linear Systems with Polytopic Uncertainties", by D. Scaradozzi, V. Bartolucci, A. M. Perdon, G. Conte, and E. Zattoni.

The paper addresses the problems of robust system synchronization for max-plus linear systems with polytopic uncertainties in all system matrices. Uncertainties in discrete event systems can arise from variations in timing constraints or processing delays. 
The work provides a methodology to tackle these problems by leveraging a geometric approach for the max-plus algebra. 
These problems aim to design a control law that ensures that the system behaves like a reference model, forcing the system's output to equal the model's output.
