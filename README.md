# MaxPlusPolytopic_RFSSP

Numerical example for the Robust System Synchronization Problem for max-plus linear systems with polytopic uncertainties.

# Abstract

This illustrative example, written for ScicosLab, supports the theoretical results proposed in the paper "Robust Synchronization Problems for \mbox{Max-plus} Linear Systems with Polytopic Uncertainties".
The paper addresses the problems of robust system synchronization for \mbox{max-plus} linear systems with polytopic uncertainties in all system matrices. Uncertainties in discrete event systems can arise from variations in timing constraints or processing delays. This work provides a methodology to tackle these problems by leveraging a geometric approach for the max-plus algebra. 
These problems aim to design a control law that ensures that the system behaves like a reference model, forcing the system's output to equal the model's output.
